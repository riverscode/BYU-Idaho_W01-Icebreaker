    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The primary purpose of this website is to create a comprehensive repository of all the tasks I will undertake
      during the WDD-130 course. This platform aims to serve as a valuable resource for my own learning journey and to
      assist my classmates in their learning endeavors. By meticulously documenting each task and project I complete,
      this repository will provide concrete examples and creative solutions, enhancing the overall learning experience
      and fostering a sense of collaboration within our course community. Ultimately, the goal is to enrich the learning
      journey for all participants by sharing knowledge and supporting each other as we progress toward web development
      mastery.</p>

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
