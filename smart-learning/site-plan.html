    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The primary purpose of this website is to create a comprehensive repository of all the tasks I will undertake
      during the WDD-130 course. This platform aims to serve as a valuable resource for my own learning journey and to
      assist my classmates in their learning endeavors. By meticulously documenting each task and project I complete,
      this repository will provide concrete examples and creative solutions, enhancing the overall learning experience
      and fostering a sense of collaboration within our course community. Ultimately, the goal is to enrich the learning
      journey for all participants by sharing knowledge and supporting each other as we progress toward web development
      mastery.</p> <!-- change this -->
