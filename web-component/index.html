    <button class="accordion">How much time do I have to complete a free course?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>There is no strict time limit to complete the free courses. You can progress at your own pace and access the
        content at any time. However, we recommend following the suggested study plan to make the most of the learning
        experience.</p>

      <p>You only need an internet connection and a device (such as a computer, tablet, or phone) to access the courses.
        Ensure you have an up-to-date browser and access to an email account, as we use email for communication and
        account recovery.</p>
